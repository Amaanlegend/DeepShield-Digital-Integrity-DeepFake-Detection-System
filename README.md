DeepShield: Multimodal Deepfake & Fraud Detection System

Overview

DeepShield is an advanced deepfake detection system developed to identify manipulated media by analyzing audio, video, and images using cutting-edge machine learning techniques. The system combines CNN + LSTM models, blockchain technology for secure logging, and cloud-based services to create a scalable and robust solution that ensures real-time fraud prevention

DeepShield provides NatWest with a comprehensive fraud detection tool that is secure, scalable, and easy to integrate into existing systems. Its multimodal approach ensainst evolving fraud threats.ures robust protection ag

Features

Multimodal Deepfake Detection:

CNN + LSTM model for deepfake detection in video streams.
Audio analysis to detect speech pattern anomalies.
Facial texture anomaly detection, analyzing skin texture and lighting irregularities.
Facial landmark analysis to spot inconsistencies in muscle movements and facial features.

Biometric Cross-Verification:

Facial & Voice Matching: Ensures consistency between voice and facial data with real-time cross-checking against pre-existing customer databases.
Real-Time Verification: Ideal for sensitive use cases like KYC (Know Your Customer) verification in financial services or fraud prevention.

Blockchain Integration:

Immutable Audit Log: Every deepfake detection and fraud prevention event is securely recorded on a blockchain ledger for transparency and legal reviews.
Tamper Detection: Media file metadata (timestamps, geolocation, and device type) is checked for inconsistencies.

Cloud-Backed Processing:

AWS Lambda & S3: DeepShield leverages AWS Lambda for processing and AWS S3 for storage, ensuring scalability and flexibility.

Evaluation Metrics:

Standard metrics include Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.
Performance comparisons with traditional classifiers such as SVM and Random Forest are provided.

System Architecture

Input Layer
Supports multiple media formats: videos (MP4, AVI), images (JPG, PNG), and audio files (WAV, MP3).
Accepts live video stream URLs for real-time verification, perfect for use cases like live KYC checks.
Optional biometric inputs (facial images, voice recordings) for cross-verification with databases.

Core Modules

Pre-Processing:

Metadata analysis for tamper detection.
Video stabilization and enhancement for optimal feature extraction.

Deepfake Detection:

Deep learning models (trained on datasets like DFDC and FaceForensics++) to detect texture anomalies, facial landmark inconsistencies, and mismatches in audio-visual synchronization.

Multimodal Fraud Detection:

Uses biometric cross-verification, along with contextual analysis based on user behavior patterns, geolocation, and recent transactions.

Blockchain-Backed Logging:

Every detection is immutably logged on a blockchain for secure, verifiable audit trails.
