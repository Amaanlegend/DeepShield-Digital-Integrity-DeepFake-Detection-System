DeepShield: Multimodal Deepfake & Fraud Detection System

DeepShield is a state-of-the-art AI-powered solution designed to combat deepfake media and prevent fraud through advanced audio-visual analysis, biometric verification, and blockchain-backed audit trails. This system leverages deep learning models to detect deepfake content in videos, images, and audio while ensuring integrity and security with real-time fraud prevention alerts.

Key Features

1. Multimodal Deepfake Detection
Audio-Visual Synchronization: Detects mismatches between lip movements and audio to flag potential deepfake media.
Facial Texture Anomalies: Identifies irregularities in skin texture and lighting, often missed by fake generation models.
Facial Landmark Analysis: Detects minute inconsistencies in facial muscles and movement (e.g., eyes, mouth) which are challenging for deepfake algorithms to replicate accurately.
2. Biometric Cross-verification
Facial & Voice Matching: Verifies facial images and voice audio against NatWestâ€™s customer database to flag inconsistencies.
Real-time Verification: Supports live video feeds and biometrics to detect fraud in real-time, making it ideal for KYC (Know Your Customer) or sensitive financial transactions.
3. Metadata Integrity Check
Tamper Detection: Analyzes media file metadata (e.g., timestamps, geolocation, camera type) for inconsistencies or signs of manipulation.
4. Blockchain-backed Audit Trail
Immutable Record: Every media analysis and result is immutably logged on a blockchain ledger for legal or audit reviews.
Secure Storage: Provides transparency, ensuring that NatWest can present legally verifiable proof in case of disputes.

System Architecture

Input Layer
Accepts various media formats: videos (MP4, AVI), images (JPG, PNG), and audio (WAV, MP3).
Supports live video stream URLs (e.g., for real-time KYC verification).
Optional biometric input (facial images, voice recordings) for cross-verification with customer databases.
Core Modules
Pre-processing:

Metadata analysis to detect tampering.
Video stabilization and enhancement to ensure clearer feature extraction.
Deepfake Detection:

Deep learning models trained on datasets such as the DeepFake Detection Challenge (DFDC) and FaceForensics++.
Texture anomaly detection, facial landmark analysis, and audio-visual synchronization.
Multimodal Fraud Detection:

Biometric cross-verification (face, voice) with existing customer data.
Contextual fraud analysis using customer behavior patterns, recent transactions, and geolocation data.
Blockchain-backed Logging:

Immutable audit log creation for every media analysis.
Ensures secure and verifiable fraud detection reports.

Installation & Setup

Requirements
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed and the necessary libraries.

Install the dependencies by running:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Setting Up the Project
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DeepShield.git
cd DeepShield
Download Pre-trained Models: Place the pre-trained models (e.g., deepfake detection, facial landmark models) into the models/ directory.

Run the DeepShield System: You can process media by running the main script:

bash
Copy code
python deep_shield/main.py --media_file path/to/media

Supported Media Types
Video: mp4, avi
Image: jpg, png
Audio: wav, mp3
Live Video URLs

Results
1.Confidence score indicating likelihood of deepfake (0 to 1 scale).
2.Highlighted areas of suspicion in the media (e.g., facial regions like mouth or eyes).
3.Fraud prevention report, including biometric discrepancies and metadata integrity.

Security & Privacy
End-to-End Encryption: All media, results, and logs are encrypted.
GDPR Compliance: The system adheres to privacy regulations, including GDPR, allowing users to delete or anonymize personal data upon request.
